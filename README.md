I found no writeup online for this challenge so here is one.

So There is the challenge:

We learn that the buffers will be small.
Let's look at it inside ghidra.

## Ghidra

Nothing interesting in the main function, let's look at the chall function.

So two buffers, the first one is large but cannot be overflowed the second is very small but can be overflowed by 8 bytes.

It appears simple enough, put some shellcode inside the first one, jump to it from the second one.

Let's analyze all this in gdb.



## GDB

First let's check security and permissions.
> checksec ./stack_my_pivot

```
Arch:     amd64-64-little
RELRO:    Partial RELRO
Stack:    No canary found
NX:       NX disabled
PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
RWX:      Has RWX segments
```

No PIE, nice. 64bit, wait we only read 24bytes, that's not a lot. Well this probably wont be a problem later.

I use gdb gef but use whatever you want

> gef> vmmap

```

```

Executable stack, nice. Let's assume ASLR is on (it is).

Ok let's see what registers we can overwrite.
We now the read is 0x1c so 24.

> pattern create 28
```
[+] Generating a pattern of 28 bytes
aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaa
[+] Saved as '$_gef0
```

We know the first one cannot be overflowed so let's not bother trying it.

> gefâž¤  c
```
Continuing.
[+] Welcome!
[+] What's your first name?

[+] What's your surname?
aaaaaaaabaaaaaaacaaaaaaadaaa
